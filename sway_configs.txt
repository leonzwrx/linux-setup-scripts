# Sway configs and further setup
# Make sure all sway basics are up and running and everything is functioning

#
# Theming and aesthetics:
#
# Change GTK theme to Nordic. Icons to Papirus and cursors to Nordzy
# 	Other options for themes:
# 	orchis-teal-dark-nord and icons colloid-teal-nord-dark OR use Breeze
# 
# Run sudo vim /etc/environment and add the following line: 
# 
# QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum
# QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
# 
# Use Kvantum to configure themes - currently using Nord-Kvantum Theme
# Since Kvantum takes precendence over qt5ct settings,
# 	select Kvantum style in qt5ct
# 	Do the same for qt6ct
#
# Others:
# 
# Copy .config files including sway, waybar, rofi/wofi, etc and any other appropriate dot files
# 

# Create a simple --user waybar.service to fix the issue of waybar not starting after reboot
# Place the script into ~/.config/systemd/user/ and enable
