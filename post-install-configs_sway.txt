###   SWAY CONFIGS POST-INSTALL ###########
###########################################
#
# - Make sure all sway basics are up and running and everything is functioning
# - Verify rofi (wayland work) launches - wofi is there for backup just in case
#
# - Go over nwg-displays and verify resolution settings
#
# - Theming and aesthetics:
#  
# If not already done,
# Change GTK theme to Nordic. Icons to Papirus and cursors to Nordzy
# Other options for themes:
#   orchis-teal-dark-nord and icons colloid-teal-nord-dark OR use Breeze
# Kvantum used for advanced and detailed theming qt5ct and qt6ct manage fonts, icons, and other settings

# Use this for /etc/environment file:

QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum # This tells Qt applications to use the theme managed by kvantum. Kvantum's themes are applied across all QT applications.
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct #(Optional): This might be a leftover setting. If kvantum is working, you can likely remove it.


# - Waybar:
# 
# - Go over all icons and verify look/feel and click functionality - look for any issues with variables set in config files or anything missing
# - Make sure alignment/borders all good 
#
# 
#
# Source INSTALL adjustments:
#
# - If necessary, for some of the applications built from source (i.e. Azote, nwg-look), icons and .desktop files may 
#     need to be manually copied from the source folder to /usr/share/applications and /usr/share/pixmaps
# - For some apps like rofi, where binary is installed into /usr/local/share, 
    verify /usr/local/share/rofi directory is moved into /usr/share to keep configs consistent

# Others:
# 
# - Verify keyboards / input settings
# - Verify power menu works (nwg-bar)
# - Verify systemd user services located int ~/.config/systemd/user are there and enabled/working - especially waybar.service
  - May need to copy those manually if desired from resources folder
# - Verify notifications and screenshots are working
# - If SDDM shows LXqt desktop in the dropdown, uninstall all lxqt components (may need to re-install lximage-qt afterwards)
