# Sway configs and further setup
# Make sure all sway basics are up and running and everything is functioning
#
#
# - Theming and aesthetics:
# 
# Go over nwg-displays and verify resolution settings 
# If not already done,
# Change GTK theme to Nordic. Icons to Papirus and cursors to Nordzy
# Other options for themes:
#   orchis-teal-dark-nord and icons colloid-teal-nord-dark OR use Breeze
#
# Reference another machine for this: 
# Run sudo vim /etc/environment and add the following line: 
# 
# QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum
# QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
# 
# Use Kvantum to configure themes - currently using Nord-Kvantum Theme (should be installed via scripts)
# Since Kvantum takes precendence over qt5ct settings,
# 	Select Kvantum style in qt5ct
# 	Do the same for qt6ct
#
# - Waybar:
# 
# - Go over all icons and verify look/feel and click functionality - look for any issues with variables set in config files or anything missing
# - Make sure alignment/borders all good 
#
# Others:
# 
# - Verify keyboards / input settings
# - Verify power menu works (nwg-bar)
# - Verify systemd user services located int ~/.config/systemd/user are there and enabled/working - especially waybar.service
# - May need to manually download wttrbar binary or fix the setup script
# - Verify nwg-display settings are persistent upon reloading sway
# - Verify notifications and screenshots are working
