###   SWAY CONFIGS POST-INSTALL ###########
###########################################

 - Make sure all sway basics are up and running and everything is functioning
 - Verify rofi (wayland work) launches - wofi is there for backup just in case
 - Verify fonts are installed (nerd fonts/ glyphs) work as expected in Waybar, etc
 - Go over nwg-displays and verify resolution settings
 - Verify sway scripts are working (autotiling, volume, top-level-switch, etc)

 - Theming and aesthetics:
  
 If not already done,
 Change GTK theme to Nordic. Icons to Papirus and cursors to Nordzy
 Other options for themes:
   orchis-teal-dark-nord and icons colloid-teal-nord-dark OR use Breeze
 Kvantum used for advanced and detailed theming qt5ct and qt6ct manage fonts, icons, and other settings

  - Use this for /etc/environment file:

    QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum # This tells Qt applications to use the theme managed by kvantum. Kvantum's themes are applied across all QT applications.
    QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct #(Optional): This might be a leftover setting. If kvantum is working, you can likely remove it.

 - ONLY OFFICE ISSUE - 
  
   Bug prevents Only Office to open normally - supposedly fixed in latest sway 1.9 and wlroots with OnlyOffice 8.1
   However, since Debian stable doesn't have these yet - even newest Only Office still won't work
   Workaround: Manually install .deb for Only Office 7.2.1 and change desktop file to have a prefix Exec=env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb  

 - Waybar:
 
 - Go over all icons and verify look/feel and click functionality - look for any issues with variables set in config files or anything missing
 - Make sure alignment/borders all good 

 Source INSTALL adjustments:

 - If necessary, for some of the applications built from source (i.e. Azote, nwg-look), icons and .desktop files may 
     need to be manually copied from the source folder to /usr/share/applications and /usr/share/pixmaps
 - For some apps like rofi, where themes are expected to be in /usr/share, move them from /usr/local/share/rofi 

 Others:

 - Verify keyboards / input settings
 - Verify power menu works (nwg-bar)
 - Verify systemd user services located int ~/.config/systemd/user are there and enabled/working - especially waybar.service
 - May need to copy those manually if desired from resources folder
 - Verify notifications and screenshots are working
 -  If SDDM shows LXqt desktop in the dropdown, uninstall all lxqt components (may need to re-install lximage-qt afterwards)
