# Sway configs and further setup
# Make sure all sway basics are up and running and everything is functioning
#
# - Go over nwg-displays and verify resolution settings
#
# - Theming and aesthetics:
#  
# If not already done,
# Change GTK theme to Nordic. Icons to Papirus and cursors to Nordzy
# Other options for themes:
#   orchis-teal-dark-nord and icons colloid-teal-nord-dark OR use Breeze
# Kvantum used for advanced and detailed theming qt5ct and qt6ct manage fonts, icons, and other settings

# Use this for /etc/environment file:

QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum # This tells Qt applications to use the theme managed by kvantum. Kvantum's themes are applied across all QT applications.
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct #(Optional): This might be a leftover setting. If kvantum is working, you can likely remove it.
