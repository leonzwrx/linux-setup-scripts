## [TLDR]
_Updated September 2025_
This repository is my take on installation, configuration and customization of Debian and Fedora. Created for me to use personally but free for anyone to use. Debian setup is minimal with no DE but built for a Wayland-based WM/DE while Fedora configuration buids on top of a minimal [Sway spin](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/sway)

## [WHAT‚ÄôS INCLUDED]

### Actual setup - Debian
- Follow standard install procedure with partitioning setup to allow timeshift btrfs snapshots - [use this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zC4S7TA1GI)
- Configure zram as well
- Verify internet connection and at minimum install `git` and `wget`
- Download this script into /tmp using wget:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonzwrx/linux-setup-scripts/refs/heads/main/debian_base_trixie.sh`
 
### Actual setup - Fedora
- Download [iso](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/sway/download), install, follow defaults
- Use standard partitioning with btrfs (may switch to manual partitioning for easier Timeshift snapshot integration)
- zram should be configured out of the box

### Install Scripts:

* debian_base_trixie.sh - installs base Debian Trixie tools and packages after minimal-install without GUI
